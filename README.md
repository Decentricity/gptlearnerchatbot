# Self-Improving Chatbot  This is a simple self-improving chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot starts with a basic set of rules and learns to respond to new inputs through interaction with the user or by training with the OpenAI GPT model. It uses a JSON file to store its memory, which consists of user inputs and corresponding responses.
